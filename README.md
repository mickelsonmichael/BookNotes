# Welcome to the Book Club

This Repository will serve as both a notes repository for the books I (@mickelsonmichael) have read, but also as a repository to practice my git command line with. 

I aim to at least be reading two chapters of some book every week (an hour a night at minimum). And while I have used Git through Visual Studio or GitHub Desktop, I am not fully versed in the art of the Git command line, so this will be necessary practice to expand my abilities a bit more, even if the commands are rudimentary I hope to get into habits and establish muscle memory.

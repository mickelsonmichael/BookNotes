# Before the Project

## Group Meeting

Some of the requirement gathering is a little difficult for us, since we don't usually interact directly with the client. Usually you should go through the BA unit. We don't really get a requirements document either, so we have to track down the questions.

Dan at one point for ACH had to call the BU guy to get the true story from him.

Jason is a big proponent of asking questions like they say in the book. Ask the difficult edge-case questions that the BU might not have normally used.

The BA's were intended to have access to the User Stories, but now they may or may not.

Kal has done pair programming in the past and likes it when:

- there is a time limit
  - No longer than 2 hours, and make sure there's a break where you switch who's driving
- there's a set goal
- the person is open to discussion

Lyn thinks that Jason won't be too keen on it, since we work so independently on different pieces. If we were to do agile, we would all do one feature together instead of having different projects.

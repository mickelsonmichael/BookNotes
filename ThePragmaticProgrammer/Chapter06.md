# Chapter 6 - Concurrency

## Meeting Notes

There was some discussion of Soda vs Pop. I don't really have an allegiance but I suppose I prefer "soda."

I expressed that I wished they had a C# specific version of this book. 
A lot of the concepts would be a lot more approachable if I could see the C# equivalent or at least some C# code samples.
They boast about the publishing scripts they run, they could have run a script to swap out code samples with particular sets like swapping all the Ruby scripts with C# scripts.

Kal liked the Blackboard for workflow and Lyn talked about [Windows Workflow Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Workflow_Foundation). 
In .NET, Lyn also says you could utilize SignalR to get the latest information from the "blackboard."

We also discussed [IFTT](https://iftt.com) and [Trello](https://trello.com)

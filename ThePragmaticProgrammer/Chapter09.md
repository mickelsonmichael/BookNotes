# Chapter 9 - Pragmatic Projects

As with previous chapters, I have since swapped to the audiobook format of the book due to it's more conversational nature. It doesn't necessarily make for good note taking material.

We talked briefly again about the importance of Unit Testing, but other than that most of this chapter was a review of the contents of the book. Most of the things were things we'd never implement at LMCU, so wasn't much benefit for now.

The conversation moved to talking about sitting down with the user or the client to get information about their expectations and perspective. Lyn and Dan noted that this is more of a BA's job, but our BA's don't really do that. But there is benefit in going to the users to ask them to show you what they do.

The conversation digressed to the post-face where we talked about the Internet of Things devices and how easily they can be hacked and taken advantage of.
